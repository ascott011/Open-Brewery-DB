# About this Repo

This straightforward project is to test API calls and data collection from an open source brewery database. Source is https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation. Data collection will be followed up with basic EDA.

## Methods

First, called API and retreived first record and only the keys to determine which fields I want to grab when I need all the data.
Wanted fields: ['id', 'name', 'brewery_type', 'city', 'state', 'postal_code', 'country']

## Fields to grab 

wanted_fields = ['id', 'name', 'brewery_type', 'city', 'state', 'postal_code', 'country']
